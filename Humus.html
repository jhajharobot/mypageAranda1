    Quick hummus recipe This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
    It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. 
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
    It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

    <p><em>HUMMUS</em> is The best hummus is lusciously creamy, yet somehow light and fluffy. 
    It’s beautifully smooth and swirled, and begging to be scooped up onto a wedge of pita bread. 
    <strong>It’s nutty and tangy, thanks to the tahini, with notes of bright, fresh lemon and mellow garlic.

        <strong><dt>HUMMUS DESCRIPTION</dt></strong>
        <dd>
            Hummus is a smooth and creamy puree of cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans), tahini sesame paste and an acid, 
            typically lemon juice. While hummus usually has garlic now, centuries ago it did not. Olive oil isn’t a requirement either, 
            but most modern recipes list it as an ingredient. Hummus has been a staple in the Middle East, Mediterranean and North 
            African regions for longer than written records have been kept. Egypt is considered to be the birthplace of the earliest versions, 
            and every variation is part of that family tree. The advent of a robust spice trade spread the high-protein dip around the globe because it's nexpensive and easy to make. 
            The ingredients themselves have a long shelf life - long enough to sustain a ship’s crew until they could get food from a new port.<img src="image/download (2).jpg">
